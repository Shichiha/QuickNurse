# Quick Nurse
This is a Terraria Mod that allows players to quickly access the [Nurse](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Nurse) healing feature in Terraria by assigning a hotkey. With this mod, players no longer need to manually click on the nurse NPC, saving time and streamlining gameplay.
This mod is highly recommended for cowardly players who are afraid of dying! (im kidding)
This mod may work incorrectly with other mods that change the nurse NPC. If you encounter any problems, please leave a comment in the [steam workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2924777290).
