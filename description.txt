Terraria Pay-to-win mod

This mod allows players to quickly access the nurse healing feature in Terraria by assigning a hotkey. With this mod, players no longer need to manually click on the nurse NPC, saving time and streamlining gameplay. This mod is highly recommended for cowardly players who are afraid of dying! (im kidding)

I added support for Calamity but it is untested at the moment
